# VR-Meditation

## Overview

VR-Meditation is a simple meditation app built for the Oculus Quest. Created in 2021, the project was inspired by a desire for a more minimal and distraction-free meditation experience than what was available in the Oculus app store at the time.

Unused assets were removed using the Unity Sweeper plugin to reduce project size.
