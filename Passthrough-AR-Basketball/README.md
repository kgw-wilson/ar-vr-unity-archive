## Overview

AR Basketball is an early augmented reality project of mine built to explore AR development using Unity and the experimental Oculus passthrough API.

## Takeaways

• Oculus Passthrough Integration - Implemented passthrough-based AR experiences using Oculus APIs.

• Physics-Based Interaction - Tuned physics materials to simulate realistic basketball movement and collisions.

• XR Rig Integration - Integrated OVR rigs with XR Interaction Toolkit components for consistent user interaction.

## Features

**1. Goal Creation and Manipulation**

Users can spawn a basketball goal by pressing the left grip button, then reposition and rotate the goal as desired using the movement of the controller

**2. Ball Interaction**

Users can spawn a basketball by pressing the trigger button on either controller. Releasing the trigger results in the natural throwing or dropping of the ball, complete with realistic bouncing off the ground or the goal.

**3. Scoring Mechanism**

Successfully shooting/dunking the ball through the hoop increments the score displayed on the backboard.
