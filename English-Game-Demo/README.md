# English-Game-Demo

## Overview

English-Game-Demo is a proof-of-concept game exploring interactive language learning through gameplay. It was developed over a few weeks as a personal project to experiment with game mechanics, UI design, and educational interaction.

Terrain (lightly modified using Unity’s built-in terrain editor) and character models (unmodified) were sourced from third-party assets. The project was later cleaned using unity-sweeper to reduce repository size.

## Features

Dialogue System

• Simple dialogue menu allowing players to select responses during conversations.
